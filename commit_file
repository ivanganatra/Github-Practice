Added a commit file

You can also write git commit -m "Added a commit file",
but for giving detailed information, you can write your
message in a file and commit it. Write the message in a
 email format, first write a subject in no more than 50
  characters, and then write a detailed description of
  what changes you made, it is not necessary but a
  recommended practice if your file has a lot of changes.
